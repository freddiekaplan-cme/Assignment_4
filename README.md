## What I Learned
What started as a very simple assignment ended up as a much larger project. I'm very interested in the card game Magic: The Gathering and wanted a somewhat niche site for searching for cards using an API.

Exploring the possibilities using an API got my creative juices flowing, and I spent a lot of time adjusting parameters, formatting search strings, and improving usability. I learned a lot about finding and working with API endpoints and reading documentation.

This is a project I'm still working on in a private repo.
